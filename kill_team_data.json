Each ASPECT TECHNIQUE can only be used with a friendly operative that has the matching Aspect keyword, and each will specify when it can be used and what its effects are. In addition:\n* You cannot use more than one ASPECT TECHNIQUE per activation or counteraction.\n* You cannot use each ASPECT TECHNIQUE more than once per turning point.\n* If every friendly BLADES OF KHAINE operative selected for deployment has the same Aspect keyword (e.g. STRIKING SCORPION), you cannot use each ASPECT TECHNIQUE more than twice per turning point (instead of once).\n\nHOWLING BANSHEE ASPECT TECHNIQUE\nTHE WOE: Howling Banshees are woe given form. Emitting sonic screeches from their helms, they hurl themselves into the stunned foe, the lightning speed of their swordplay cutting through the enemy before a blow can be landed in return.\nSCREAM-THAT-STEALS: Use this ASPECT TECHNIQUE when a friendly HOWLING BANSHEE operative is fighting or retaliating, at the start of the Resolve Attack Dice step. You can resolve one of your successes before the normal order. If you do, that success must be used to block.\nACROBATIC: Use this ASPECT TECHNIQUE when a friendly HOWLING BANSHEE operative performs an action in which it moves. Until the end of the action, that operative: Can ignore all vertical distances whenever it drops and climbs.\n\nDIRE AVENGER ASPECT TECHNIQUE\nUse this ASPECT TECHNIQUE when an operative is shooting a friendly DIRE AVENGER operative, and you\u2019ve rolled two or more fails. You can discard one of them to retain the other as a normal success instead.\nTHE SLICING HURRICANE: Use this ASPECT TECHNIQUE when a friendly DIRE AVENGER operative is performing the Reposition action. That operative can perform the Shoot action during that action (it must do so in a location it can be placed, and any remaining move distance it had from that Reposition action can be used after it does so). You must select its shuriken catapult, shuriken pistol or twin shuriken catapult for that Shoot action.\nDEATH OF A THOUSAND BLADES: Use this ASPECT TECHNIQUE when a friendly DIRE AVENGER operative is performing the Shoot action and you select a shuriken catapult or twin shuriken catapult. Until the end of that action, that weapon has the Torrent 2\" weapon rule, but you cannot select more than one secondary target.\n\nSTRIKING SCORPION ASPECT TECHNIQUE\nMERCILESS STRIKES: Use this ASPECT TECHNIQUE during a friendly STRIKING SCORPION operative\u2019s activation. Until the start of its next activation, while that operative has a Conceal order and is in cover, it cannot be selected as a valid target, taking precedence over all other rules (e.g. Seek, Vantage terrain) except being within 2\".",
